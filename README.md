## Perks

- I can speak fluent English and it wasn't that long ago that I decided to take an English Certificate test where I earned the [C2 Proficiency Qualification](https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams-and-tests/proficiency/), native Spanish speaker and I'm on my way to add Japanese to my repertoire.

- I love open source projects and that's why I decided to develop my on [GitHub Action](https://github.com/jctaveras/heroku-deploy) which motivated me to write my [first Dev Post](https://dev.to/jctaveras/the-power-of-automation-with-github-action-244o)

- One thing that I love the most about my job as a Software Engineer is to share my experiences whenever I can. I've been working with React, TypeScript, Hapi and Sequelize for a while now and I just found some weird behaviours when adding TypeScript to Sequelize so I wrote another Dev Post about [How to Setup Sequelize with TypeScript](https://dev.to/jctaveras/sequelize-typescript-what-you-need-to-know-41mj).
